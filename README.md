<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">Instructions:</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="13">Write a program that defines a bot who displays a greeting, its name and the date of its creation.<br>
You will introduce yourself to the bot and he will greet you by your name and then try to guess your age using arithmetic operations.<br> 
You will program the bot to count from 0 to any positive number you entered.<br>
Each number starts with a new line, and after a number, the bot should print the exclamation mark. Do not output any extra characters in these lines with numbers.<br> 
Then, you will improve your  bot so that it can give you a test and check your answers. The test should be about programming. Your bot has to continue to ask the 
test until you answer correctly.<br>
The bot can ask anything you want, but there are two rules for your output:<br>
    • the line with the test should end with the question mark character;<br>
    • an option starts with a digit followed by the dot (1., 2., 3., 4.).<br>
    If a user enters an incorrect answer, the bot may print a message: "Please, try again.".<br>
The program must end with the "Congratulations, have a nice day!" message.</p>
