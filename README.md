**Java project: Simple Chatty Bot****


Instructions:

Write a program that defines a bot who displays a greeting, its name and the date of its creation.
You will introduce yourself to the bot and he will greet you by your name and then try to guess your age using arithmetic operations. 
You will program the bot to count from 0 to any positive number you entered. 
Each number starts with a new line, and after a number, the bot should print the exclamation mark. Do not output any extra characters in these lines with numbers. 
Then, you will improve your  bot so that it can give you a test and check your answers. The test should be about programming. Your bot has to continue to ask the 
test until you answer correctly.
The bot can ask anything you want, but there are two rules for your output:
    • the line with the test should end with the question mark character;
    • an option starts with a digit followed by the dot (1., 2., 3., 4.)
If a user enters an incorrect answer, the bot may print a message: "Please, try again.".
The program must end with the "Congratulations, have a nice day!" message.
